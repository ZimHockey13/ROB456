    "\n",
    "Think of these as functions as simulating real-world events - query the sensor for if the door is open (y/n), ask where the robot is (contiuous location OR a grid square in the world), ask which room you're in (discrete variable, kitchen dining room), take a distance reading with noise, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "These can be thought of as fancy versions of a coin toss (returns T/F with 50% probability each), a roll of the dice (returns 1..6 with equal probability).\n",
    "\n",
    "ALL of these \"simulate probability\" routines for discrete variables can be implemented using JUST numpy's uniform number generator  (generates a number between 0 and 1 with all values equally likely). The simplest way to think of all of these methods is that you chop up the unit interval 0..1 into the number of possible outcomes, with each bit of the unit interval representing how likely that event is. Then you just generate a number from 0 to 1 and see which bin you fell into.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why the functions are set up they way they are: You need to input how likely each discrete event is. There's three basic methods for specifying this.\n",
    "1) List each discrete event and how likely it is\n",
    "2) All events are equally likely, just say how many there are (bins) and the mapping between the bins and the 'labels'.Usually the bins represent some spatial variable like location or angle, but could be a movement\n",
    "3) There is a function that represents how likely each event is, with the x coordinate representing some continuous variable like distance (think Gaussian error for movement)\n",
    "\n",
    "For each method that you'll implement the above information is passed in using a dictionary. I'm using a dictionary (instead of a class) because it's a bit easier to understand/implement, but the 'right' way to do this is as a class."

This is common with locations (grid up the space), images (pixels), volume levels on most digital devices, etc. This is often called *binning*, because you are binning continuous values into discrete bins.\n",

Instead the \"labels\" are the (typically) the value at the center of the bin. Rather than specifying unique labels for each bin, it's normal to just provide the start/stop boundaries and the number of divisions. The usual assumption is that all bins are equally likely; so if there are n bins, then the probability of generating any specific bin label is 1/n.\n",

So it's a combination of the discrete variable (using a running sum to determine which bin you fall in) and the bins (chopping up a continuous variable into bins). \n",

You can actually do continuous functions, but it's a bit trickier and we don't need it (see for example https://www.comsol.com/blogs/sampling-random-numbers-from-probability-distribution-functions/)\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example we're going to use a class instead of a method because (in order to make it efficient) you want to pre-calculate a running sum from the given probabilities. It would be very expensive to do this every time you asked for a sample, like you did in the discrete problem.\n",
